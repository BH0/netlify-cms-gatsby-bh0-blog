Ultimately, I have known how to program for over four years and I have experimented with a variety of languages. 
<!-- more --> 
Out of all the languages (Python, C, Ruby, Java, C# etcetera), I had used; Javascript was my primary language. For good reasons too. 

## I Could Do More Faster 
Javascript had so many learning resources that it was incredibly easy to learn something. But, most importantly, it was easy to do something - I could program procedurally, use a variety of the existing libraries (Jquery etcetera), and have something graphical that is worth showing to someone in a short amount of time. 

## Freedom 
Javascript has many quirks - and I surprisingly enjoyed learning about them, but Javascript was pleasant to write as I did not need to worry about crazy rules that other languages enforce - such as everything needing to exist inside a class (Java). 

## The Future And Opportunity  
Javascript started as a "toy" language, a nice easy method for webmasters to make websites do cool things. But it has grown (and continues to grow) to do so many more. For example, 3D (ThreeJS), machine learning,  (BrainJS), data analysis, server-side (NodeJS), Internet Of Things, games, mobile (R-Native, Cordova, voice assistance, Ionic, productivity, automation, audio (ToneJS) desktop (Electron) and many other types of applications can be made using Javascript - so its no surprise that it is among the popular programming languages. Not to mention, many modern (and future) programming languages draw inspiration from Javascript. And Javascript itself continues to be a language which keeps evolving. 

## Any Regrets? 
Not quite, I have ultimately enjoyed learning Javascript - and I continue to learn it. But, I am adding other languages to my skillset )C# in particular), and I am keen to explore the newer languages such as Kotlin, Dart, Elm and Go.
