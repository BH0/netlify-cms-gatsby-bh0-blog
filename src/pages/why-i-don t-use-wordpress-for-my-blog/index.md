Many people suggest Wordpress as the go-to blogging platform - even for technical people. I have nothing against Wordpress (I actually love [most of] it). But never the less, here are the reasons I decided to use a static site generator over a content management system/blogging platform.  
<!-- more --> 

Please note that my opinion fits a "niche", and may not work for you. I looked into using a variety of static site generators, at first I thought Jekyll, ultimately I chose Hexo. I built my first blog with Hexo - and loved Hexo but have now moved o Gatsby; I intend on producing a blog post as to why I switched and my experience switching [eventually]/ 

 # Custom But Not Repetitive or Time-Consuming 
This is the ultimate reason why I opted for a static site generator. First, I considered creating my blog using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS - but thankfully realized this was a bad idea.  So, I felt a static site generator was a nice "best of both worlds" of using custom technology, without having to waste time doing repetitive tasks. 

# Free As In I'm Too Cheap For Web Hosting 
When you are a beginner in web development and have never been employed as a web developer; you do not want to be spending money unless it feels like a sure thing - and given that I grew up not enjoying reading/writing intensive classes in school - blogging for me did not feel like  a sure thing. So, with a static site generator, I knew I could host my blog on Github Pages for free (and there are now more freeing deployment/hosting solutions). 

# An Excuse To Learn 
Lastly, I had played with a content management a lot before I started my blog, and I had done a lot of projects using various technologies, but I did not have an idea of what I could use a static site generator. My blog was the perfect project for learning this unfamiliar territory of technology, and I love static site generators (especially React, hence why I enjoy Gatsby and intend on doing a React-Static project soon). Though, I can understand someone who does coding all day not wanting to code when they are not getting paid, but I don't have this opinion. 

# Sorry For The Possibly Misleading Title 
Well, you have reached the end (somehow), thanks. As you know this was not about Wordpress being bad - its just, in web development; each type of tool (whether it be a framework, CMS, new-kid-on-the-block etc) has a defined problem to tackle. And a static site generator tackled my problem of procrastinating in creating a blog.
