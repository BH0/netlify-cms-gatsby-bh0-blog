# Should You Rush Or Take Your Time Coding? 

If you are wondering wether there is an advantage to rushing programming, as opposed to ensuring you make as little typing and other types of mistakes as possible, read this.

# Often times, rushing seems better 
Sometimes, you just really need to see your program working, and therefor decide to rush. You can type fast.. but when it comes to running your code, its difficult to predict how long it will take you to debug what is likely a simple bug that could had been avoided had you just typed a tiny bit slower. 

# I Understand 
Often times, I code fast because it means I don't have to worry about forgetting the solution to my problem, but there are various factors such as interruptions that could also result in my forgetting my solution. For this reason I choose to make sure I have the "cliff notes" version of what my solution may look like, before I type it - for example, as a flowchart, pseudocode or something else. 

# You make mistakes when you rush 
With this in mind, I try to resist from typing "as fast as I can", I usually make sure I have time to type what I aspire to type in advance, and instead I focus on typing a solution without [too many] careless mistakes.
