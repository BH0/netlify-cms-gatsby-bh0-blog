This blog post is about the two types of javascript. As there are two (and about 10+ variants) - and I hope to (help) clear up a misconception.

Javascript has come a long way from being the toy language of the web everyone once knew. It is now just as valuable as Java and Python etcetera. Many applications and multiple types of applications (web, mobile, desktop) are built using Javascript - often times in more ways than one. 

The two main areas Javascript appears are the client side, and the server side. 

# Client Side JS
This is the closest to Javascript's origin story, Javascript remains to be an effective language for graphical user interfaces and is amazing at handling complex interactions. This is typically where Javascript is used to generate and manipulate HTML; whether it be a web-app, mobile app or desktop app. 

# Server Side JS 
Javascript, thanks to a platform called NodeJS (built on top of Google Chrome's engine), is typically used for server side programming, and can essentially do the same stuff as C#, Java, and PHP. 

# So Be Careful When You See Javascript Developer 
I tend to avoid the term Javascript developer now, because in most scenarios - especially a job posting; it is too vague of a term. So, when you hear someone say "I'm a Javascript developer", please don't assume they are a "pretend programmer/glorified web designer" - because that is often times far from the case. 

But, in terms of dialect; they are (for the most part) the same.
