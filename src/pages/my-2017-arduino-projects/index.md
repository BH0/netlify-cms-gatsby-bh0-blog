### Arduino September Blog Post

I’ve always been into electrical devices and slightly aspire to develop my own robotic application, so I was motivated to learn some electrical circuitry. Around the time of November 2016, I considered getting either the Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I decided to get the Arduino and got it during December. I continued doing some research into the device as well as general electronics. Then from January until July I vowed to make at least one electronic circuit along with its custom program (sketch) per month. And did some studying too. 

I now feel fairly familiar with basic electronics and microcontroller programming. So this blog post will tell you about the projects which gave me the knowledge I have today. The reason I’m doing this is that I plan on increasing the scope of my projects but by adding complexity I’ll be requiring more time but I may not be able to develop as frequently as I;d like to due to other commitments. For just about every one of these projects I used: the Arduino IDE, Fritzing, and a text-editor / word processor. 

The code and possibly a Frizzing diagram of the circuit for these projects is viewable via Github. 

### January - ICanSingARainbow 
Components: Breadboard, RGB Led, Wires 
Description:Essentially my earliest Arduino project, all it was was an RGB LED which displayed each colour of the rainbow. 
Code: *to be added* 

### February - MorseCode 
A circuit and sketch which went through the alphabet in Morse code and outputted it via two LEDs. 
Code: *to be added* 

### March -  RockPaperScizzors Simulation 
The scope of this project was way too big for the free time that I had, however it allowed me to simulate the result I wanted to achieve without running into too much hassle. I also enjoyed brainstorming the project’s user experience and interface design. At a later date I hope to return to this project and complete it. 
Code: *to be added* 

### April - ToneTest 
This was just to experiment with what can be done with a Piezo buzzer. I remember making an interesting “revving” sound. 
Code: *to be added* 

### May - AlternatingLEDs 
I originally planned to work with a DC or Servo motor and while I wrote the code for one of these motors, realised I didn’t have time to complete the circuit so I instead made a quick sketch and circuit which helped me revise some skills I had previously learnt by making two LEDs light up at different times. 
Code: *to be added* 

### June - Piezo Buzzer Sketch 
A circuit which I am very proud of, I made it play a small version of “Twinkle Twinkle” and also composed some tunes/melodies of my own - exercising my high school music theory knowledge. The project also gave me an opportunity to produce my own libraries (using header files). 
Code: *to be added* 

### July - Temp Sensor RGB LED 
Just a quick project to based on a combination of my early projects, instead of going through the hassle of building this circuit, I instead decided to test the sketch’s code and circuit using Circuits.io / Electronics Lab (Autodesk) - a web-based application which allows you to make and simulate circuits virtually. The LED is supposed to display a warm colour (red, orange etcetera) depending on the warmth Of The temperature sensor, or a cold colour (blue) if it is cold. 
Code: *to be added*
