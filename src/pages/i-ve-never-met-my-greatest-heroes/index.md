# I’ve Never Met My Greatest Heroes - 2017 

While learning to program, there have been a ton of people who have helped me make it through “hard times”, and make decisions I might not have made well on my own. But I’ve never met these people - four years of learning to program and not once have I met them. 

<!-- more --> 

Me not having met these altruists is a lie; I have met them, just not in person - so this blog post is just to say that when learning to program, you may feel alone and isolated, but you’re not. 

There are thousands of people who are either going through what you’re going through - or have survived it, and even better: these people actually want to make things better for you (the reason/s why is a different blog post). 

So, where are these people - simple: in the digital realm. 

There are tons of digital communities (some which have in-person events too) dedicated to making the journey of a programmer easier. So don’t be afraid to visit them and ask a question every now and then (I perhaps ask too frequently at some points). 

Some of the places I recommend at this moment are listed in this post but you’re welcome to visit wherever you please and form your own opinion. Digital communities: “Codebar.io”. Discord Servers (Reactiflux, Traversymedia, Game Dev League, Developers, Electronic Projects). Obviously there are many more and this is a thank-you to each of those helpful communities - and not that I support favoritism but a special thanks to those individuals who have had a major positive impact on my adventure . 

One thing I will say though is: try and have netiquette, try not to waste anyones time, and don’t take the help for granted - at least take twenty or so minutes to solve your own problem first because reaching out for help.
