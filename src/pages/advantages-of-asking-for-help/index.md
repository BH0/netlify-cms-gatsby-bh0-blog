As a programmer you’re more than likely to encounter a problem or error which youll struggle to handle.

It may be tempting to not tell anyone about it and suffer in silence - until you accomplish your task. Conquering something alone can feel rewarding, but sometimes you just have to put your dignity in the drawer, and lock it.

By this I mean: ask for help. Don’t worry about feeling negative or not smart enough etcetera. Sometimes you might go to ask for help, but as you verbally (or textually) explain your issue discover the solution.

While I encourage asking for help, I discourage deliberately wasting other peoples time - so make sure you really do need help and you have an idea as to the kind of help you need. It may help to read The XY problem”.

Anyways, back to asking for help - or at least sharing your problem / activity and not suffering in silence.

If you have something to share, share it with others, they might be able to help. By sharing your successes AND STRUGGLES with others you’ll improve your ability to communicate, are relieving yourself from unwanted stress, are stimulating the minds of others (many benefits to this) and you might actually make it through your current struggle.

Just to clarify, the intention of this post is to inform you that socialising can actually be productive even when you think it won’t be. Thanks for reading.
