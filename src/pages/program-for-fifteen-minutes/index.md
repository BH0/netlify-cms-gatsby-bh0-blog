Despite enjoying programming, times will arrive when you will not feel motivated to do it, this blog post aims to help you overcome that feeling.

## Code For A Short Time 
There are many factors that contribute to your motivation to program. But, if none of these factors are effective as you would like them to be, and you think - I should program, but I don't feel like it - then do one thing. That is: force yourself to program for at least a certain short amount of time -  15 minutes is what works for most people. 

## Why 
The reason for this is that starting is typically the hardest part, once I start programming and continue to do it for more than fifteen minutes, I lose track of time - and before I know it; I've been programming for over 40 minutes. 

## When That Time Has Ended 
Once you have been programming for fifteen minutes, or however long you chose, it is your option to stop. You can do one of three things; keep coding (for as long as you like), or take a break and code again for a short time, or stop coding - the choice is yours. 

## Do Not Overcode 
Coding can be rewarding, it is a great feeling when you are ready to show that awesome app you created to your friends, but coding is a cognitive skill; that is - coding requires brain power, and we can only use so much brain power within a given time before we run out. Thus, it is important not to code so much that you are draining your brain from power - avoid this by allowing it time to recharge; by not coding and doing something else like chilling, sleeping, eating, socializing, exercising or pretty much anything else that does not require as much brain power as coding does. Personally, I've noticed I suffer a reluctant to begin programming again after a tough-going session of programming.
