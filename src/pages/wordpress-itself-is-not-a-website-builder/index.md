Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress blah blah blah, if you searched for "easy to use website builder", chances are you are being flooded with advertisements for these [and similar] platforms. 
<!-- more --> 
I do not know much about Squarespace nor Wix. I do however know, that Wordpress.org [the open source tool for developers]  is not a website builder by itself. It does not offer a user-friendly drag and drop interface for the building of websites. 

## What Is Wordpress.org 
Wordpress [at least ".org"] is a content management system. This means that it is a tool for managing content -  for example, it allows the content manager to easily produce and update content such as blog posts, images, etcetera. 

## But, People Use Wordpress As  A Website Builder 
This is very true, Wordpress offers something called plugins - installations which add extra functionality to Wordpress, and themes - installations which are for the presentation of content. 

While many themes (some for free, some not) allow their content, and to an extent, their appearance to be easily customizable - their sole intention is simply to present the content in a pre-determined manner. 

## To Turn Wordpress Into A Website Builder You Need A Plugin 
Plugins come in all shapes and sizes, but I'll cut to the chase - there are various plugins which turn Wordpress into a page (and thus website) builder. 

## So, Some Examples Please? 
Sometimes these plugins have to be combined with other products, sometimes they can be hidden inside themes. And their pricing can vary dramatically. 

### Black Studio TinyMCE Widget  + SiteOrign Page Builder 
This combination is what I started out with, it is free; but very minimal. 

### Beaver Builder 
This offers much more flexibility, it offers template layouts - which are pre-designed pleasant layouts. And Beaver Builder's user interface is fairly intuitive. I believe there is a free version of it, which is what I used - but in my opinion, the price range is a bit too steep. Having said that, I did like this plugin. 

### Elamentor 
I cannot remember using this, though I do remember thinking to myself - I need to use this. There is a free version too, and the personal site variant's pricing which is for 1 site is pretty fair at $49. 

### Divi 
This is a heavyweight plugin - in fact, I am not even sure if it is classed as a plugin, long story short - this is way too expensive for me to consider using, however, a lot of "web designers" (I am a web developer) favor this one - probably due to the features its packed with. 

#### These Are Expensive For Me 
Yes, I agree, if you are looking just to build a website for a local small business on a low budget (perhaps even as a favor). these options can feel a bit overkill (with the exception of the free options). But what you should understand is that if you are looking to start a "web design agency" of sorts - these tools are an investment to your business. If your client demands that you specifically use one of these tools - then they should pay for the tool themselves. However, if the client is none the wiser about what you are using, then you should ensure a percentage of each client's payment goes towards the tool/s you use. I am sure these plugins easily play nice with other [popular] plugins, but you should try them out - assuming you have the luxury to do so - to find which one you prefer. 

### Why Did I Write This 
When I first started using Wordpress, I began using it thinking that it was the answer to all my problems, but I soon realized I was wrong - and that it was only a gateway to some of the answers of my problems. The blog post also aims to ensure that you take a step back, and truly consider if Wordpress is the right tool for the job.
